# Issue Triaging with Discord Notifications

*Forked from [shubhaamgupta11/repo-monitor](https://github.com/shubhaamgupta11/repo-monitor).*

It is designed to monitor new issues in the React Native repository and send notifications to Discord for better issue triaging.

## Features

- Tracks new **issues** in the React Native repository.
- Sends notifications to **Discord**.
- Allows configuring **Discord** notifications to mention users or roles.

## Usage

### Monitor Issues with Discord

Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/monitor.yml) with the following:

```yml
name: Monitor React Native Issues

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # Runs every hour
  workflow_dispatch: # Optional to trigger manually

jobs:
  run-notifier:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - name: Monitor New Issues
        uses: react-native-community/repo-monitor@v1.0.0
        with:
          # required inputs
          task: "monitor-issues"
          git_secret: "${{ secrets.GIT_SECRET }}"
          notifier: "discord"
          fetch_data_interval: 1  # Hours (must align with your cron schedule)
          # repo inputs
          repo_owner: "facebook"
          repo_name: "react-native"
          # Discord-specific inputs
          discord_webhook_url: "${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL }}"
          discord_id_type: "<user/role>" # Optional: Only needed to ping someone directly.
          discord_ids: "<user-id/role-id>" # Optional: Only needed if discord_id_type is provided. Can pass multiple similar type ids separated by commas. e.g. "Uyyyxxxx,Uzzzxxxx"
```
